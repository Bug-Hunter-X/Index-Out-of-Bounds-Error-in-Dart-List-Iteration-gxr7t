# Dart IndexOutOfBounds Bug

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Dart when iterating through lists.  The example code attempts to access an element beyond the valid index range, resulting in an `IndexOutOfRangeException`.

The solution shows the corrected loop using a less error prone method.
